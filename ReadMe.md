  Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative code. Here are some key characteristics of functional programming:

1. **Pure Functions**: A pure function is a function that, given the same input, always produces the same output and has no side effects. It does not modify data outside its scope, making it predictable and easier to reason about.

2. **Immutability**: Functional programming favors immutability, meaning that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, new data structures are created to represent updated values.

3. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values. Higher-order functions can take one or more functions as arguments or return a function.

4. **Avoidance of State Mutation**: Instead of mutating state directly, functional programming encourages the use of pure functions and immutable data structures to manage and update state.

5. **Declarative Programming**: Functional programming emphasizes expressing what needs to be done, rather than how to do it. Declarative code focuses on describing the desired outcome and relies on functions and data transformations to achieve it.

6. **Recursion**: Recursion is commonly used in functional programming instead of traditional iterative loops. Recursive functions call themselves with modified arguments until a base condition is met.

7. **Higher-Level Abstractions**: Functional programming relies on higher-level abstractions such as map, filter, and reduce to perform operations on collections of data, promoting code reuse and readability.

Functional programming can provide several benefits, including improved code maintainability, testability, and parallelism. It encourages writing modular and reusable code by focusing on composing small, pure functions. However, it may require a shift in mindset and may not be suitable for every use case or programming scenario.
